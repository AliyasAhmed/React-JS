# Installation Process for React.js

#### 1. **Install Node.js**

- React.js requires Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager) for managing packages.

   - **Windows/macOS/Linux:**
     - Download Node.js installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
     - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

   - **Verify Installation:**
     - Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows).
     - Type `node -v` and press Enter. You should see a version number (e.g., v14.17.3).
     - Type `npm -v` and press Enter. You should see a version number (e.g., 6.14.13).

#### 2. **Create a React App**

- React provides a tool called `create-react-app` to quickly set up a new React project.

   - **Open a Terminal:**
     - Windows: Use Command Prompt or PowerShell.
     - macOS/Linux: Use Terminal.

   - **Run Command:**
     - Type `npx create-react-app my-react-app` and press Enter.
       - Replace `my-react-app` with your preferred project name.

   - **Wait for Installation:**
     - This command will create a new directory (`my-react-app`) with a basic React project setup.

#### 3. **Navigate to Your React App**

- Once `create-react-app` finishes, navigate into your new project directory.

   - **Change Directory:**
     - Type `cd my-react-app` and press Enter.

#### 4. **Start the Development Server**

- React uses a development server to preview your app locally.

   - **Run Command:**
     - Type `npm start` and press Enter.

   - **View Your React App:**
     - After a moment, your default web browser should open with your React app running at `http://localhost:3000`.
     - If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

#### 5. **Congratulations!**

- You've successfully installed React.js and created your first React app.

### Summary

By following these steps, you've installed Node.js, created a new React project using `create-react-app`, navigated to your project directory, started the development server, and viewed your React app in the browser. This setup provides a solid foundation for building React applications.
