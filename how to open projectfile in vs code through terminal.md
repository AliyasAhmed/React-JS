# The command `code -r dirname` is used to open a file in Visual Studio Code and closing the previous files. Here's what each part does:

- `code`: This is the command to open Visual Studio Code from the terminal.
- `-r`: This stands for "reuse window." It opens the file in an already open Visual Studio Code window, instead of opening a new one.
- `dirname`: This is the name of the file you want to open.

So, `code -r dirname` will open the specified file in the current Visual Studio Code window. In short we dont have to do `cd` to specific folder again and again all we can do is `code -r dirname`
